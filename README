# Running Code with Different Testcases

Multiple TAs:
To change the number of TAs, edit ta.txt to contain the desired number of tas (default 4)

Different number of exam files:
To change the number of exam files, change line 175 of exam_problem_101257741_101297186.cpp to be: 
    if (argc <= (3 + desired_number_of_files)) {
and line 228 to be:
    for (int i = 3; i < (3 + desired_number_of_files); i++){
and place the files in any order into the command to compile

Changing Rubric: 
To change the rubric, edit rubric.txt

Terminating on student id 9999
Student id 9999 is contained on exam9.txt in the stored testcases. Place the exam files in the order so exam9.txt is read when termination is desired.
